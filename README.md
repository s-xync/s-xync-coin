This is a code along project for the following tutorials...  
1. [Creating a blockchain with Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124)  
2. [Proof-of-work implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneatE69814)  
3. [Miners rewards and transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRV6cGXVQ4I&t=117s)  

Throughout this project, I have gotten a solid understanding of how a blockchain really works. Before doing this project, I have known theoretical working of blockchain very well. After doing this project, I was able to get a real technical understanding of what I knew.  

Even though, this project is small, I am very glad that I found time to go through this tutorial.  

Thanks!
